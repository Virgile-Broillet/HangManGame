# HangManGame
I code an Hangman Game in 20mins, that was for a Univ Exam

Run the code in Visual Studio Code or XCode (for MAC Users)
Then enter the word your mate should guess, then play

The main file is entirely documented for doxygen (it's a bit simplistic but the documentation was included within 20 mins)

Any FeedBack or anything else
